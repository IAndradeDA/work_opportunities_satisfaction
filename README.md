# Project: Work Opportunities Satisfaction Analysis

## Overview

In this project, the goal was to collect experimental data and do a complete end-to-end analysis. I chose to [survey](https://forms.gle/WYqMp6MfDXvCWyuT8) people about their experience with working after college studies and whether it was enough to be satisfied with the work opportunities and expected growth. 

The results were presented in a dynamic Tableau dashboard. You can find it [here](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/ines.andrade/viz/Projecto_Universities_Studies_Vs_Career_Opportunities/Dashboard1) on Tableau Public.

## Sample Collection

- Sample: people with college and working experience.
- Online Survey

## Analysis

1. Data cleaning with python
2. Data Analysis - Statistic Analysis
    - Since most of the answers were categorical ('Yes' or 'No') I used test association (Chi-squared test) to search for the dependent variables. 

## Conclusions

Based on the tests, it's possible to conclude that job satisfaction is not independent of the number of other courses taken in different fields. In fact, the more courses taken, the higher the level of satisfaction with work opportunities.

The data collected also show a significant difference between Portugal and other countries. However, I don't have enough entries to conclude with certainty. I'll need to gather more information to retrieve more meaningful insights.
